### Week-2

<b>Dominance: </b>
An action(a) for a player(i) strictly dominates action (b) if 'a' leads to better outcomes than 'b' for the player(i) no matter what other players are doing. Here, (b) is strictly dominated by (a). An action (a) for the player (i) is called strict dominant action if 'a' strictly dominates all other actions of the player (i). <br>
Actions are the same as Strategy in normal games. <br>
<b>Strictly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium:</b>
A strictly dominant strategy equilibrium is an action profile where each player's action is strictly dominant. In Prisoner's dilemma both the players' strictly dominant strategy is to choose Confess.
<br>
Good News: Our actions are to follow the strictly dominant strategy and no need to worry about the other's strategy.<br>
Similarly, Weakly dominant strategy equilibrium can be defined.
